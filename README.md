# Typing Game

## test your typing abilities...

This game will allow its user to practice their typing skills by typing
according to what is on their screen. The application will track may track
typing accuracy, words per minute, and even possibly have a scoring system. This game
is made for people of all ages as typing is an essential skill that allows for fluent
technology usage. Therefore, kids who are just learning how to type, or adults who are trying
to improve their typing can use this game to have fun while developing a skill!

This project interests me because I began learning how to type when I was in grade 2, and
the websites that I practiced on such as NitroType were extremely addictive. I would like
learn how to code a simple game that can benefit its player in multiple ways.
