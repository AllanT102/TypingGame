### Inspiration

This project interests me because I began learning how to type when I was in grade 2, and
the websites that I practiced on such as NitroType were extremely addictive. I would like
learn how to code a simple game that can benefit its player in multiple ways. 

### User Stories

As a user, I want to be able to attain a score and add it to a scoreboard. 

As a user, I want to be able to view all my previous scores and set new high scores on the score board.

As a user, I want to be able to see the words that I need to type and the output of what I am currently typing. 

As a user, I want to be able to see my percentage accuracy. 

#### Phase 2

As a user, I want to be able to save my player information so that I can see if I can get a higher score the 
next time I play whenever I quit the game. It will automatically save for me. 

As a user, I want to be able to load into the same player account the next time I play.

#### Phase 3

As a user, I want to be able to add my scores to a scoreboard, see a countdown, see the words I am typing, and the 
ords I need to type.  

As a user, I want to be able to login to my account and prompted to save my user information before I quit.
